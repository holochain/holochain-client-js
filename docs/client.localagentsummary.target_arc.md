## LocalAgentSummary.target\_arc property

The target arc that the agent is trying to achieve as a storage arc.

This is not declared to other peers on the network. It is used during gossip to try to sync ops in the target arc. Once the DHT state appears to be in sync with the target arc, the storage arc can be updated towards the target arc.

**Signature:**

```typescript
target_arc: DhtArc;
```
