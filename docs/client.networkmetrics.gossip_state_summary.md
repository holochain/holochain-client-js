## NetworkMetrics.gossip\_state\_summary property

A summary of the gossip state.

This includes both live gossip rounds and metrics about peers that we've gossiped with. Optionally, it can include a summary of the DHT state as Kitsune2 sees it.

**Signature:**

```typescript
gossip_state_summary: GossipStateSummary;
```
