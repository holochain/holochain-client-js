## 2025-03-11: v0.19.0-dev.8

### Changed
- Updates the `AppBundleSource` type according to Holochain PR [#4651](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/4651) and adjusts the tests accordingly.

## 2025-02-20: v0.19.0-dev.7

### Fixed
- Fix DhtOps helper functions `getChainOpType`, `getChainOpAction`, `getChainOpEntry` and `getChainOpSignature` to adhere to the new types
### Changed
- Updated types to the new [enum serialization convention](https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.5.0-dev.19/holochain_conductor_api/docs/index.html#enum-serialization-convention). The following types are affected:
  - `SignalType`
  - `CellInfo`
  - `InstallAppRequest`
  - `RoleSettings`
  - `DnaSource`
  - `RegisterDnaRequest`
  - `CoordinatorSource`
  - `AppBundleSource`
  - `AppStatusFilter`
  - `CloneCellId`
  - `GrantedFunctions`
  - `CapAccess`
  - `DnaStorageBlob`

  Enum variants are now consistently `snake_case` and typically distinguished by a `type` attribute, unless for enums with exclusively unit-like variants.

  Example 1:
  ```
  // OLD
  export type AppBundleSource =
    | { bundle: AppBundle }
    | { path: string };

  // NEW
  export type AppBundleSource =
  | {
      type: "path";
      value: string;
    }
  | {
      type: "bundle";
      value: AppBundle;
    };
  ```

  Example 2 (unit-like variants only):
  ```
  // OLD
  export enum AppStatusFilter {
    Enabled = "Enabled",
    Disabled = "Disabled",
    Running = "Running",
    Stopped = "Stopped",
    Paused = "Paused",
  }

  // NEW
  export enum AppStatusFilter {
    Enabled = "enabled",
    Disabled = "disabled",
    Running = "running",
    Stopped = "stopped",
    Paused = "paused",
  }
  ```

## 2024-11-28: v0.19.0-dev.6
### Added
### Fixed
### Changed
- Change `InstallAppRequest` type to adhere to the new format that includes the `roles_settings` field and removes
the `membrane_proofs` field as membrane proofs are now specified as part of the `roles_settings`.
### Removed

## 2024-11-21: v0.19.0-dev.5
### Changed
- Simplify zome call parameters. `cap_secret`, `provenance` and `payload` are optional parameters of a `CallZomeRequest`. If implicit zome call signing is used, which happens when calling a zome with a `CallZomeRequest`, `provenance` and `cap_secret` are automatically set with the authorized signing credentials. It is still possible to call a cell by its role name instead of its cell id. Alternatively to passing in a `CallZomeRequest`, `callZome` can be invoked with a signed request `CallZomeRequestSigned`, where the zome call parameters have already been serialized and signed.

## 2024-11-21: v0.19.0-dev.4
### Fixed
- Bring back optional cap_secret to zome call parameters.

## 2024-11-20: v0.19.0-dev.3
### Changed
- Zome call signing has been changed in Holochain to remove the requirement of imitating Holochain serialization. Signing is now a simplified process of serializing zome call parameters using MessagePack, then computing a SHA2 512-bit hash of the serialized bytes and signing the hash. The zome call payload consists of the serialized bytes and the signature.

## 2024-11-12: v0.19.0-dev.2
### Added
- AppWebsocket calls to interact with countersigning sessions, i.e. `GetCountersigningSessionState` as well as `AbandonCountersigningSession` and `PublishCountersigningSession` when a session could not be resolved automatically. Countersigning is an unstable feature which must explicitly be enabled in Holochain.

## 2024-10-28: v0.19.0-dev.1
### Added
- Bring back a websocket reconnection automation for Admin and App websockets. When either of them is closed and a new request made, it will attempt to reconnect using the same app authentication token that was used to initially authenticate the websocket. A specific `InvalidTokenError` is returned if that fails.

## 2024-10-09: v0.19.0-dev.0
### Changed
- Update to Holochain 0.5.0-dev.0

## 2024-09-30: v0.18.0-dev.12
### Fixed
- Type `RevokeAgentKeyResponse`, which returns an array of tuples with cell id and error message for all cells that key revocation failed for.

## 2024-09-30: v0.18.0-dev.12
### Added
- Admin API call `RevokeAgentKey`.

## 2024-09-26: v0.18.0-dev.11
### Added
- Util function to compare two cell ids `isSameCell`.
### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Clone cell ids have changed from accepting a `CellId` to a `DnaHash`.

## 2024-08-05: v0.18.0-dev.10
### Changed
- Signal listeners changed from only returning an `AppSignal` to a `Signal` which can be either an app or system signal.

## 2024-08-05: v0.18.0-dev.8
### Changed
- Revert addition of @hc-spartan/holo-hash. Hashes were used inconsistently and lead to wrong types for return values.

## 2024-07-23: v0.18.0-dev.7
### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Use package @spartan-hc/holo-hash for managing hashes, instead of custom functions. `AgentPubKey` is a new type now instead of a `Uint8Array`.

## 2024-07-16: v0.18.0-dev.6
### Added
- New value `NotStartedAfterProvidingMemproofs` for type `DisabledAppReason` which effectively allows a new app status, corresponding to the specific state where a UI has just called AppRequest::ProvideMemproofs, but the app has not yet been enabled for the first time.
- New `AppWebsocket` call `EnableAfterMemproofsProvided`, which allows enabling an app only if the app is in the `AppStatus::Disabled(DisabledAppReason::NotStartedAfterProvidingMemproofs)` state. Attempting to enable the app from other states (other than Running) will fail.
- New field `lineage` to the DNA manifest, which declares forward compatibility for any hash in that list with this DNA.
- New `AdminWebsocket` call `GetCompatibleCells`, which returns `CellId` for all installed cells which use a DNA that is forward-compatible with a given DNA hash. This can be used to find a compatible cell for use with the UseExisting cell provisioning method.

## 2024-07-09: v0.18.0-dev.5
### Fixed
- Hash part utility functions for core hash and DHT location. Both were using an incorrect number of bytes.

## 2024-06-27: v0.18.0-dev.4

### Added
- Added missing `base` field to the `Link` type. This exists in Holochain but wasn't present in the client.

### Changed
### Fixed
- Refer to type, not `this` in a static context to fix a bug in the `AppWebsocket` that would result in `this.requester is not a function` when the client is used in as JavaScript environment.

### Removed

## 2024-06-13: v0.18.0-dev.3
### Changed
- `DhtOp` was split into `ChainOp` and `WarrantOp` in Holochain.

## 2024-06-11: v0.18.0-dev.2
### Added
- New call `AppRequest::ProvideMemproofs`. An app can be installed with deferred membrane proofs, which can later be provided through this call.

## 2024-05-10: v0.18.0-dev.1
### Added
- App id to `AppClient` and `AppWebsocket`.
- Optional function parameter for a custom zome transformer in `AppWebsocket`.

## 2024-05-02: v0.18.0-dev.0
### Added
- Test for Rust enum serialization.
### Changed
- **BREAKING** Update enum serialization to match [changed Conductor API serialization format](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/crates/holochain/CHANGELOG.md#040-dev1).

## 2024-04-27: v0.17.0-dev.12
### Fixed
- Invalid module references which caused the client to fail to import in Node environments.

## 2024-04-26: v0.17.0-dev.11
### Changed
- **BREAKING** Changed `Appwebsocket.connect()` to take a single parameter `AppWebsocketConnectionOptions` that includes the `AppAuthenticationToken` as an optional property. The `AppAuthenticationToken` can be omitted if it is provided by the `window.__HC_LAUNCHER_ENV__` variable.
- **BREAKING** The legacy  framework specific zome call signing methods `signZomeCallTauri` and `signZomeCallElectron` have been removed. Runtimes like Launcher now mandatorily need to provide a `window.__HC_ZOME_CALL_SIGNER__` object to have zome calls be automatically signed.
- New optional parameter to `attachAppInterface` to bind the app interface to a specific app.
- **BREAKING** The admin call `listAppInterfaces` now returns a list of `AppInterfaceInfo` instead of a list of ports.

## 2024-04-25: v0.17.0-dev.10
### Added
- **BREAKING** Connecting an app websocket now requires an authentication token which can be obtained from the admin
  websocket using `AdminWebsocket#issueAppAuthenticationToken`.

### Changed
- **BREAKING** Merged the app and app-agent websockets into a single `AppWebsocket` class. Following the addition of the
  authentication token, the two types were well enough aligned that there was no longer a need to keep them separate.
- **BREAKING** App calls that previously required an `InstalledAppId` no longer require one because the websocket will
  be authenticated with an app already, so the app interface no longer requires you to tell it which app you are calling.

## 2024-04-16: v0.17.0-dev.9
### Fixed
- Replace all IPv4 addresses `127.0.0.1` by `localhost`.

## 2024-04-05: v0.17.0-dev.8
### Changed
- Websocket client: Specify `origin` parameter when establishing app websocket connections to protect localhost from cross origin attacks in browser scripts.
- Websocket client: Add `allowed_origins` parameter to `AdminWebsocket.attachAppInterface` to specify allowed origins.
- Consistently throw `HolochainError`s throughout with specific error names and messages.

## 2024-02-27: v0.17.0-dev.7
### Fixed
- Type: `AppInfoResponse` can be `null` if the requested app is not found.

## 2024-02-23: v0.17.0-dev.6
### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `Websocket.connect()` functions' mandatory `url` parameter is replaced by an optional options object, which contains optional properties `url` and `defaultTimeout`. Calling `connect` if the url is not defined by parameter, nor by launcher environment will throw an error. Order of parameters in the `AppAgentWebsocket.connect` function is changed, so the required parameter goes first.

## 2024-02-02: v0.17.0-dev.5
### Fixed
- Work around cell_id being a proxy object in Vue.

## 2024-01-27: v0.17.0-dev.4
### Changed
- Decouple host zome call signer from environment. Now a zome call signer can be provided separatedly from the environment that the client is used in.

## 2023-11-29: v0.17.0-dev.3
### Added
- Utility functions for slicing hashes into their components: `sliceHashType`, `sliceCore32`, `sliceDhtLocation`
- Utility functions for generating hashes from components: `dhtLocationFrom32`, `hashFrom32AndType`:
### Changed
- Utility functions fakeAgentPubKey, fakeEntryHash, fakeActionHash and fakeDnaHash now generate *valid* hashes with a valid final 4 bytes
- Utility functions fakeAgentPubKey, fakeEntryHash, fakeActionHash and fakeDnaHash now optionally take a single parameter `coreByte` which if defined will be repeated for all core 32 bytes of the hash

## 2023-11-22: v0.17.0-dev.2
### Fixed
- Action type `CreateLink`: Add field `link_type`.

## 2023-11-16: v0.17.0-dev.1
### Added
- Type `Link` to HDK and a confirmatory test.

## 2023-11-08: v0.17.0-dev.0
### Changed
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Conductor API ser/deserialization has changed on Holochain side. Tags are serialized like `{ type: { app_info: null } }` now, when before it was `{ type: "app_info" }` for requests and responses.

## 2023-10-17: v0.16.3
### Fixed
- `CapAccess` types `Unrestricted` and `Transferable` were not correctly implemented. Both need to be nested objects containing a single property with a Pascal cased name, e. g. `{ access: { Unrestricted: null } }`.
- `AttachAppInterfaceRequest` took a mandatory property `port`. The property is optional now.
### Removed
- Dropped support for Node.js v16 after its end-of-life.

## 2023-09-19: v0.16.2
### Added
- Support for signing zome calls in electron via `window.electronAPI.signZomeCall` when `__HC_LAUNCHER_ENV__.ENVIRONMENT == 'electron'`.
### Fixed
- `DnaProperties` in `DnaModifiers` changed to `Uint8array` as it comes back serialized from Holochain.

## 2023-09-05: v0.16.1
### Changed
- Update `InstallAppRequest` with new optional field `ignore_genesis_failure`.

## 2023-08-07: v0.16.0
### Added
- When generating a signing key pair, a new optional argument can be passed in to copy the last 4 bytes (= DHT location bytes) of the original agent pub key.
### Changed
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Swap cryptographic package from `noble/ed25519` to `libsodium`. This lead to helper functions become async and some type changes.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Set type of `Memproof` to `Uint8array` instead of `Buffer` which is specific to Node.js.

## 2023-08-02: v0.15.1
### Added
- Export functions to check if a role name is a clone id.
### Fixed
- In Vue projects reactivity broke signal functionality provided by Emittery. A pointer to `this` which Emittery relies on becomes undefined. Until the bug is fixed upstream in Emittery, the workaround is to bind all its methods manually after instantiating an agent websocket.

## 2023-06-16: v0.15.0
### Added
- When making a WsClient request, reconnect websocket in case it's closed.
### Changed
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Refactor client and websocket classes to use URLs instead of strings.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Error responses from Holochain are thrown as instance of new class `HolochainError` which extends `Error`.

## 2023-05-04: v0.14.1
### Fixed
- Import crypto module conditionally when in Node.js environment. For browsers and bundlers no module import is required and the Web API module is used. Add
```javascript
...
    externals: {
        "node:crypto": {}
    },
...
```
to Webpack config.

## 2023-05-01: v0.14.0
### Changed
- Set default timeout for API calls to 60 seconds, formerly 15 seconds.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Replace NPM package "tweetnacl" with "@noble/ed25519". "tweetnacl" produced errors with bundlers and hasn't been updated in a longer time.
### Fixed
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Update params of `NetworkInfoRequest`.

## 2023-04-15: v0.13.0
### Added
- Add new Admin API endpoint `storageInfo`.
- Add new Admin API endpoint `dumpNetworkStats`.
- Add new Admin API endpoint `updateCoordinators` to update coordinator zomes in an already installed hApp.
### Changed
- Update response type `NetworkInfo`.

## 2023-03-01: v0.12.5
### Fixed
- Replace event listener method `.on("close")` by `.onclose`. `.on` is not compatible with Web API's WebSocket.

## 2023-03-01: v0.12.4
### Fixed
- When app websocket closes, reject pending requests.

## 2023-02-24: v0.12.3
### Changed
- Throw an error when calling zome with role name and provenance from `AppAgentWebsocket`. Role names can only be used with own agent, not for other agents.

## 2023-02-13: v0.12.2
### Added
- Function to generate a fake DNA hash.
### Changed
- Switch to Nix flake for develop environment. Run `nix develop` from now on instead of `nix-shell`. Pass on `--extra-experimental-features nix-command --extra-experimental-features flakes` or enable these features for your user in [`~/.config/nix/nix.conf`](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/conf-file.html#conf-experimental-features).
