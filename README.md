# Holochain Client - JavaScript

A JavaScript client for the Holochain Conductor API (works with browsers as well as Nodejs).

> Holochain's Conductor API is under active development. This client package tracks that development fairly closely but sometimes gets behind.

## Installation

To install from NPM, run
```bash
npm install --save-exact @holochain/client
```

> This code is still under alpha development and npm releases are pre-releases with `dev` tags meaning they will not use full semantic versioning, and you may wish to lock to an exact version of the library for that reason, as shown in the above command.

## Sample usage

### Use AdminWebsocket
```typescript
  const admin = await AdminWebsocket.connect(`ws://localhost:8000`, TIMEOUT)
  await admin.generateAgentPubKey()
```

### Use AppWebsocket
```typescript
  const signalCb = (signal: AppSignal) => {
    // impl...
    resolve()
  }

  const TIMEOUT = 12000
  // default timeout is set to 12000
  const client = await AppWebsocket.connect(`ws://localhost:${appPort}`, 12000, signalCb)

  // default timeout set here (30000) will overwrite the defaultTimeout(12000) set above
  await client.callZome({
   cap: null,
   cell_id,
   zome_name: "test_zome",
   fn_name: 'test_emitter_fn',
   provenance: fakeAgentPubKey('TODO'),
   payload: null,
  }, 30000)
```

### Use AppAgentWebsocket
```typescript
  const signalCb = (signal: AppSignal) => {
    // impl...
    resolve()
  }

  const TIMEOUT = 12000
  // default timeout is set to 12000
  const appWs = await AppWebsocket.connect(`ws://localhost:${appPort}`, 12000, signalCb)

  const client = new AppAgentWebsocket(appWs, 'installed_app_id')

  // default timeout set here (30000) will overwrite the defaultTimeout(12000) set above
  await client.callZome({
   cap: null,
   role_name: 'dnas_role_name', // role_name is unique per app, so you can unambiguously identify your dna with role_name in this client,
   zome_name: "test_zome",
   fn_name: 'test_emitter_fn',
   provenance: fakeAgentPubKey('TODO'),
   payload: null,
  }, 30000)
```

## API Reference

See [docs/API.md](docs/API.md)


# Holochain Compatibility

See [default.nix](./default.nix) for the Holochain version this package is compatible with.

If updating the Holochain version included in holonix, please use `niv update` as explained in the
[Holochain Installation Guide](https://developer.holochain.org/install/#upgrading-the-holochain-version).

## Running tests

You need a version (`stable` toolchain) of Rust available.

You need `holochain` and `hc` on your path, best to get them from nix with `nix-shell`.

To perform the pre-requisite DNA compilation steps, and run the Nodejs test, run:
```bash
nix-shell
./run-test.sh
```
